      <strong>Sharukh's Bio </strong>

<p>Hi! My name is Sharukh. My last job was at a family-owned business for three years. During my time there, I was an iPhone and Computer repair technician as well as the manager and sales person.</p>
<p> After hearing about the inspiring success of a family-friend who completed a bootcamp, my software web developer studies came into a rapid fruition.</p>
<p>My brother, Glenn, who is studying python noticed my interests in coding, and he gave me quite a lot of resources to get started!</p>
<p>I am making a lot of progress, bit by bit!</p>
<p>I hope you do enjoy this project that Zay and I are working on.</p>
