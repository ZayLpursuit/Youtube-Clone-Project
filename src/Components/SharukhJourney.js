<p > <b>Sharukh's Journey</b></p>
  
  I graduated Brooklyn Friends High School in 2013 and went to College. I was burnt out from high school and my health was not stable. I ended up leaving NYU Tandon School of Engineering without a degree. Later I would enroll at CUNY Queens College. I did exceptionally well, however, my health was still not at the level it should be. I had been diagnosed in High School with BiPolar Disorder. I was broken from my hospitalizations and considered these experiences to be a failure of a human being. It prevented me from moving forward.
  
  I later found support at Jawda Institute, where I learned basic Arabic and met a lifelong friend and his father, a professor at CUNY and Sheikh. It was here that I began a journey of self-improvement
  

<p>I realized college didn't work for me. I had to start my life somewhere. But where? My dad offered me that if I learned the wireless phone stores operatations through a little experience, he would aid me financially to open a store. I found a temporary job at a local wireless store. My boss and manager were among the kindest people I have ever met. I grew here, and learned a lot not only about the wireless industry, but also about myself. Shortly afterwards, I left this wireless store and I began my role in GDS Wireless. I managed the store for three long hard years, struggling to pay rent and other expenses, but managing to survive. Here, I learned how to repair phones and computers through self-study on youtube and forums. I learned about people and I learned about myself.</p>
  
 <p>Today, I am studying to become a software developer. I want to change my situation, and have financial freedom. I have hopes that one day, I would be able to give back to those who were there for me when I was in need.</p>
