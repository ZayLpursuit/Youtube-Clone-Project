          <strong>Zay's Journey </strong>
<p>I have always had a passion for tech. Growing up, I wondered what was the source that enabled me to play video games, use a cell phone, and even watch a television. I  wanted to know what was going on behind the scenes and my inquisition landed me on the banks of the vast sea of the tech world.</p>
<p>At age 22, I began using resources such as freecodecamp.org and Youtube to give me rudimentary knowledge about programming. In a few weeks I was able to write my first lines of code and in a month had the skill needed to style my first page using Flexbox. I was coding everyday and thought I surely wanted to develop my skills en route of becoming a software engineer. However, work, school and family related issues completely derailed me off my tracks. For two years I didnt write a single line of code but the passion remained. After my 25th birthday I made a vow to myself to follow my dreams and completely submerge myself in the depths of software education. After doing research on internships and bootcamps, I lucky fell upon the Pursuit Fellowship. After applying , I prayed and waited for a response while trying to refresh the knowledge I acquired before. After an arduous interview process, I was accepted. Tears filled my eyes because I knew it was the start of a dream come true. After 6 months of intensive training and learning the fundamentals of HTML CSS Node JS and React JS , I am able to build projects like this and the best is yet to come!</p>
